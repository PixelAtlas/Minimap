# What
PixelAtlas is a template engine for https://pixelcanvas.io/ for the entire community. It's simple! It's easy to install, easy to use and has many awesome features.

There are basic features such as:

- Zooming
- Grid
- Cursor
- And a few other small ones

But, there are some "fancy" features we've also included:

- Saving your settings to cookies, so it remembers exactly how you like your minimap setup.
- Free modification of cursor and grid transparency.
- Option to hide grid and cursor.
- Option to only show templates from certain factions/groups/categories.
- Goto search, so you can find creations with ease.(edited)

# Sounds good, where can I get it
Due to issues that have occurred in the past, the actual code is private, instead we provide an obfuscated version, that can be found here: https://github.com/PixelAtlas/Minimap, in the public repository containing every  factions' art.

You will need TamperMonkey, a simple Chrome extension, installed beforehand.

# Can I add my own templates?
Every person and/or faction is free to request their own templates to be added. For single man projects, your template will be filed under "Community". For factions with more than 10 members, you are free to ask for your own category.

Some rules apply to what you can and can't upload.

- If templates cross paths, negotiation must take place between said factions in order to place the templates non-overlapping.
- It is much preferred if the templates are given to us as canvas colours.
- No content illegal under British, Finnish or German law, no XRW symbols (such as defined here: https://www.trafford.gov.uk/residents/community/community-safety/docs/extreme-right-wing-symbols.pdf).
- No NSFW, gore or sexual content.

If your template does not violate any of these rules, go ahead and send a message in #requests stating the x, y, width, height, and name of the template, with the image attached (of course).
